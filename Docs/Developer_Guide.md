## Branch Naming Conventions

### Feature Branches

**Format:** `feature/<yourname>-<description>`

**Examples:**

- `feature/adnan-email-service`

## Summary

**Three rules to remember:**

1. **Always branch from and merge to `integration`**
2. **Never wait for review to start new work**
3. **Keep feature branches short (1-3 days)**

Follow these, and you'll never be blocked! 🚀
